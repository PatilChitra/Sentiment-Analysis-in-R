# Sentiment-Analysis-in-R
Natural language processing

This project involves analyzing five years of student and employer feedback data using an R-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. The goal is to formulate and present strategies by utilizing text mining techniques such as n-grams to optimize student performance, resulting in an 88% increase in positive sentiments.

## Data
The data used in this project is from the 'Strength', 'Weakness', and 'Goals' sheets of employers reviews from 2018 to 2020 by Drexel university student's co-op program..

## Analysis
The sentiment analysis was performed using the `syuzhet` library in R. The main sentiment in the Employer data sheet was analyzed by comparing sentiments among responses. As expected, most responses were positive.

Four positive sentiments were compared in the responses: Trust, Anticipation, Joy, and Surprise.

To determine if responses in all the subgroups have a similar trust sentiment, the analysis was performed across different subgroups, including:

- Co-op: 4 Co-op and 5 Co-op
- Citizenship: US Citizen and Non-US Citizen
- Co-op Number: Only, First, Second, and Third/Final
- Class: FR, JR, SR, PJ, SO

Additionally, sentiment analysis was conducted on the 'Weakness' and 'Goals' sheets to identify areas for improvement and potential strategies.

## Results
The analysis revealed insights into the sentiment patterns across different subgroups, as well as areas of weakness and goals identified by employers. These findings can be used to develop strategies for optimizing student performance and increasing positive sentiments.
